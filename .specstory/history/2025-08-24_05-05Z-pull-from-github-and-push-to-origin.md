_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking how to pull from the github remote and then push to origin. Looking at the terminal selection, I can see that there are two remotes configured:

Perfect! I've successfully executed both operations:

## âœ… Pull from GitHub Remote
- **Command**: `git pull github main`
- **Result**: Updated your local repository from commit `4b22ee6` to `6060184`
- **Changes**: Added 1 file (`pages/3_Prompt_Management.py`)

## âœ… Push to Origin Remote
- **Command**: `git push origin main`
- **Result**: Successfully pushed the changes to your origin remote
- **Status**: Your local `main` branch is now in sync with both remotes

## For Future Reference:
- **Pull from GitHub**: `git pull github main`
- **Push to Origin**: `git push origin main`

The reason your original `git pull github` command failed was because you didn't specify which branch to pull from. Since you have two remotes configured, you need to be explicit about both the remote and the branch when pulling from the non-default remote.

Your repository is now up to date with both remotes! ðŸŽ‰
